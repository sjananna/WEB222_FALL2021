        <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
        
        <p>Responsive design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the website by creating the appearances which are right according to the screen size and orientation of the device that has been used. Responsive design teams create a single site to support many devices, but need to consider content, design and performance across devices to ensure usability. By RWD now web developers can be available for their work or development throughout the whole time by using only mobile or any kind of device that have screen and the graphics card. RWD is a break point by which how a layout of the site will be appear, will be decided by using the designing modules.</p>


        <h1>The Relation Between Responsive Design and Web Applications</h1>
       
        <p>The term of responsive design is that, design for any kind of web related applications or sites according to the customers preferences are possible due to this RWD for any kind of devices with varies screen views. The reason behind for which the responsive design can be related with the the web technologies is because the same HTML is served to all the devices. It has been possible by the use of the CSS to change the appearances of the page. We nowadays do not need to create separate site and the codebase for the wide screen devices. RWD can support a single codebase which will be responsible for the different sizes of viewpoints on any websites. This is the reason for which RWD is so popular among the web developers who are earning by creating amazing web applications for the clients who are not only running the companies but also the online stores and e-commerce business .</p>
       

        <h1>The Learning Experience of Building Web Applications for Different Devices throughout my Research</h1>
        <p>According to my point of view building web apps is quite promising and popular for any kinds of devices we are current using. From phone to computer desk, web apps are our day to day handy applications which are not used only for creative motive but also to make our day to day living easier. I have learned a lot about the web applications throughout my WEB222 course research. A web application is an application software that runs on web server, unlike any computer based programs that are run on the operating systems. Web applications are accessed by the user  with an active network connection through a web browser.  These applications are programmed by a client-server to provide these applications to the user (the client) through an off-site server that is hosted by a third party.</p>

        <h1>Learning Experience in the Course Web 222</h1>


        <p>The learning experience in this course was really great. I get to learn about the java script at first. According to my professor nowadays it is better to learn java script before html or css to learn about web development. I think that as we are at the end of our semester and we do agree that his decision to teach us the java script before html and css is way too much better decision than teaching us  html or css before JS. Through this course I created website where I added the video or audio etc. I had to learn deeply about DOM and how to use java script and the html with css. For me this course taught me more about web applications than any other tutorial I ever had.  </p>
